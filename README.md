**WIP - a Vue.js powered Giphy reaction board**

Yeah, hey, I got bored and decided to write a simple web app that pulls from the Giphy API.

* It's gonna be responsive.
* It's gonna be accessible.*
* It's gonna use Giphy API for data.
* And it's gonna be badass.

<sub>*Gifs seem pretty limited in terms of accessibility, but at least I can provide the alt text!</sub>

MIT License and all that, do what you will.  Don't expect me to give you other things though.
